    <h3>About Chopper</h3>
        <p>Chopper is an amazing father and husband. He has a wife named Margo whome he has been married to for 34 years and a son named Earl who is 33 years of age. His carear of choice and last carear was welding and fabrication.
            He held a postion as the prep-man at Spokane Galvanizing before an unfortunate event left him permanantly disabled. His wife Margo Baldwin told him that though he may be disbled, he needed to find something
            to do other than sit around the house. For this he took up buidling models and collecting/selling diecast cars.
        </p> 

        <p>Chopper has been buidling and collecting die cast on and off since he was a child. I know, hard to believe he was young enough to be a child am I right? He also got his nick name Chopper as a child.
         As a kid, chopper used beer cans to help with the cities for his hot wheels and other diecast. Well, his step father also had a chopper that one day he put a beer can on the gas tank of.
         Mind you he had also just finished buidling this chopper and it was sitting in the front yard. Long story short, chopper climbed up onto the chopper to get that beer can he thought was empty
         and down came tumbling that chopper with Chopper on top. When his step dad noticed the bike falling, all he had time to yell was Chopper. Ever since the name has stuck.
        </p>
        <p>Though Chopper collects a plethora of diecast. His absolute favorite diecast to collect are the M2's. They feel like both a diecast and a model to him, another hobby he has. He collects all makes
            and models, however his favorite will forever be a Dodge, or maybe a square body Chevy, or perhaps a 57 Bel Air. Wait, no... its the Rat Rod. Anything Rat Rod right? Bah, who knows. He likes them all.
